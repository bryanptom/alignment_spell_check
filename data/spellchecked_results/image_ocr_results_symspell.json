A very pretty picture she made so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittle. Ivies were creeping above and around her head reaching after the sunlight while lilies geraniums and hyacinths were blooming at her feet. The gentlemen passed on as also did the hands of the clock but still Ethel sat in evident study. The room was furnished with cultured taste and skillful hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends. It was library and sitting room combined. Ethel parents had always striven to have their home attractive even if other expenses had to be curtailed very closely. The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of the mother were sadly missed by the daughter. tHe rest of the family said that Ethel took moth eros place to them all so well that for the time they were not great losers and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to be elsewhere rather then from actual pain said that she was having a rest in mind and body for eThel did not neglect anything and she kept the little mother fresh and dainty and the room so bright and cheery that all the family would gather around her in social glee. Ethel would first notice mothers tired look if they stayed too long and pleasantly chiding them would drive them off to the sitting room. Clay Whittle used often to come in with Hal to the mothers room and these little visits were seasons of de light to him His mother had passed the portals over into the other side. How he missed her room and her counsel and the time spent over at the Braces were choice minutes and great helps to him. His father was a leading politician bis sister a fashionable woman while he him self was a law student. The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together and on passing out from it she stopped a moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister. Clay she asked Why didn't you bring Eva Dayton this evening. I prefer the company TO have he answered. Company good enough I dare say but I like to see a girl with some style of dress. Everything she wears is a year old. Which of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world he answered joined Ethel and passed on. So on this the following morning Ethel was trying to study out some plans for new clothes. Of course she was indignant over the remark but it was true that all she had was a year old but she had felt that they were good enough until now. She knew too that all they had to live upon was her fathers salary which might have seemed large to many but their expenses were correspondingly large and with mothers sickness and Toms college bills or a part of them somebody had to economize and really deny them selves and she had felt willing and even anxious to do her share but after over hearing the remark of the night before denying herself had not been so sweet. She examined the closets to see if there was anything available to be made over but returned to her low rocker disheartened. Her father came in and seeing something amiss asked what are your thoughts like daughter and what are your wishes Speak and if half of the kingdom is desired it shall be yours I thought I was queen of the realm and mistress of all survey. I desire no more than the home kingdom with a robe of royal purple. Or some other fashionable shade he said. Frankly Ethel what were you thinking about I was wondering if there was any sur plus money in the family treasury that I could use for myself she said. I think about forty dollars. Would it help you Yes indeed. Just the sum I want. The father seemed to hesitate. Ethel spoke quickly I do not want it if it is needed elsewhere. I'll let you know at tea time he said. Will balance accounts for the month and rest assured you shall have it daughter if father can spare it and seated on one knee with her arm twined around his neck she stroked his manly beard caressing. We are not rich Ethel. he said but this home is ours and is a very pleasant and an attractive one and i have A family of whom I am both proud and thankful There is one thing upon which I con a late myself every week of my life and it is this that there are no be bills coming in for payment out period by family.

They all wore the solemn look the democrats carried with them today. The democrats asserted that the conference in no way related to political questions but further than that they stopped short.

WASHINGTON Oct of. iNformation of the formidable uprising in Korea resulting in the disappearance and probable death of the queen and the landing of military forces by the United States and European powers has been received by Minister DURING OF JAPAN FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE AT TOKyo. It is quite sensational indicating the landing of marines by Russia the United States and probably Great Britain. The latest dispatch to Minister During states that a force of Russian marines of in number has been landed. Thus far they have confined themselves to guarding the Russian legation at Seoul. United States marines were landed from the Yorktown to the number of of. It is believed also that British marines have been Handed. Besides these the Japanese have a considerable force of soldiers at Seoul who have been preserving order. The dispatches cope from Tokyo and communicate the substance of dispatches received from General Mira the Japanese envoy at Seoul. They are dated from the eth to the with inst. It appears in these dispatches that the trouble had its inception through the queens dislike of the newly organized soldiery of Korea. The old soldiers had the primitive equipment of the far east but with the progress of Japanese influence in Korea two battalions of Korean troops were organized on modern methods. Each battalion numbered of a men armed with modern weapons. They were well drilled and office red. Tai Won Kun Leads the Anti royal Forces When the queen showed her disfavour to ward the so new troops they appealed to the Tai Won Kun a powerful chief who has long been at enmity with the queen. He accepted the leadership of the new troops and at the head of one battalion entered the queens palace. The native soldiers fled from the palace. Tho Tokyo dispatches do not state specifically what became of the queen further than that she has disappeared and cannot be located. The officials are inclined to believe how ever that the unofficial reports of the queens death are true. the Japanese government the dis patches further state has acted quickly on the reports and has appointed a com mission to inquire into the facts. In the meantime it is emphatically denied that the queens death if it has occurred was due to the Japanese. One report is that a Japanese Sushi killed the queen. This is not yet confirmed in the dispatches received here. The officials say that the Sushi are an irresponsible and lawless class and that their acts cannot be laid to the Japanese people or government. General Murals reports also cover the work of Japanese troops in preserving or der. These troops were stationed opposite the palace having secured this point of vantage some time since through the Korean government. They took no part in the attack on the palace but after it had occurred when tho native troops were fleeing and the new battalions were enforcing their success in capturing the pal ace the Japanese troops aided in preventing bloodshed and disorder. It is probable that some deaths occurred during the me lee. Following this came the landing of United States and Russian marines and as is believed the landing of the British. Prince Park Likely to Rule Korea. The latest indications are that the Tai Won Kun and the king are in control of affairs at the Korean capital. The king has been the nominal ruler but the queen has heretofore been recognized as the real ruler. The influence of the king and the Tai Won Kun are distinctly favorable to the Japanese. At the Korean legation no word has been received from the disturbed capital. The officials are much exercised and do not doubt that the queen has met her death although they are not ready to abandon hope. In case official confirmation is received there will be such formal ceremony as is usual on the death of a sovereign. Tho legation will go into mourning but there is not likely to be a funeral service although this has been considered as a further mark of respect. Recent news from Korea makes Prince Park lately prime minister of that country the central figure of interest in Washington. He has been here for the last law weeks and is impatiently awaiting an expected summons from the members of the progressive party of which he is the leader asking him to return and resume his mission of reforming the government. He is likely to be the future ruler of Korea. i", "465": "STEUBEN VILLA OF. Oct. of. At Hone Gale OF. Miss Buckingham a highly table young lady was met by a man named Legged.

Governor Clark furnished fresh evidence of his determination to prevent the Cornett Fitzsimmons fight at Hot Springs or in Arkansas. A telegram was sent by the governor to Brigadier General John A. Taylor of For rest City of the Arkansas state guard summoning him to a conference at once. The meaning of the conference is that the governor desires to acquaint himself with the available strength of the state militia of that he may act knowingly if the situation at Hot Springs reaches a crisis where the services of the militia may be required. General Taylor is expected to arrive to day and consult with the governor. According to the offers contained in telegrams and letters received at the executive office Governor Clark estimates that the services of of of a men are at his disposal for the purpose of putting down the fight if needed. These offers como from all parts of the state. Clark Determined to Prevent the Fight A vigorous determination to prevent the fight is plainly discernible in the significant proceedings at the executive office. Indeed Governor Clark was more emphatic than ever in saying that the fight would net be allowed to come off in Arkansas. He goes so far as to say that if the affair recurs as advertised at Hot Springs he would resign and try to find an office that he could run. tHe governor says cOrnett and Fitzsimmons have been warned and if they now arrive at Hot Springs bent on the mission of fighting their presence in the city or county will be considered an overt act and will be treated accordingly. The governor says he will do everything within the scope of his power to prevent the big mill. He says that he realizes that Hot Springs is anxious to retrieve its past misfortunes and he would like to help the city but in this instance his duty is plain and he will use his utmost deli fence and power to do what it is his duty to do. He would not like to put the state to the expense of sending several companies of the state militia to Hot Springs and he hopes the principals and their backers in the proposed fight together with all parties concerned or interested till not impose the necessity of ordering the militia to the scene in order to stop the fight. Concluding his interview Governor Clark said he did not want to see any blood shed as a result of the pugilist refusal to refrain from making preparations to fight. He sincerely hoped that it would be avoided. TO am neither seeking nor slighting any responsibility in this matter he contain bed and will do my duty. When questioned in reference to the proposition to change the affair into a love contest Governor Clark said that bes could make no distinction between glove contest and a prize fight.

Fitzsimmons cannot come to this city and give such an exhibition as is provided for in our article of agreement as they now stand a limited number of rounds with soft gloves the authorized officers being empowered to stop the exhibition if it be comes brutal then the exhibition will surely not take place in Hot Springs. The best authority at our service says that this will be no violation of the laws of the state but to make ourselves absolutely safe the citizens committee has engaged the best representatives of the legal profession in Arkansas and they are looking diligently into the matter at this time. We shall have a decision from them by to morrow and upon their advice we shall act. The matter will be brought into the courts as soon as we can get it there. If we cannot have the fight here we have an absolute guarantee of protection from three different places in Mexico one of them just across the Rio Grand from Al Past.

Nature was in and the weather was not all thai could have been desired. The visitor came by every train and the committees were very early abroad providing for the comfort of their guests. It was an immense undertaking to provide for the thousands who visited the city but every detail had been arranged to nicety and the proceedings were marked with the best of order. If any of our guests have been overlooked slighted or treated graciously the fault was not of the heart for Waterbury to outdo itself on this occasion. people of all classes co operating with the committee to make the affair a success. It is estimated that there are four thousand Odd fellows in the city and hundreds of visitors have been coming by train and trolley cars. The fact that it is a legal holiday created by the late session of the general assembly in honor of the martyred president lIncoln added to the interest in the exercises and undoubtedly increased the crowds it being an idle day in many places. The factories schools and business houses are closed and altogether it is the greatest celebration Waterbury has ever witnessed. Despite the immense crowds on the street good order was maintained. Telegrams were received by the local authorities from Boston New York Springfield and Hartford that many pickpockets and thieves had left for Waterbury. to was also said that the city was over run with lewd women but up to a o'clock no complaints had been made to the police. The center of attraction was the visiting Rebekah of a in number. The Maiden members paraded behind the band from the depot. They held a meeting in the Scot ill house late this The Maiden encampment acted as escort to the grand patriarch. The Decorations. The decorations were the most general and artistic ever seen in the city. Private residences vied with business houses in an effort to outdo each other with the result that almost every building in the center and many on the outskirts too were resplendent with flags bunting and banner test every description. The visiting Odd fellows must have been led to believe when looking at the different buildings that their brethren in Water bury owned the town. And they were right for the place was theirs for to a day. Some of the decorations were al little amusing and caused the initiated to believe that those hanging them out meant to give offence to the order but this was not the ease as those conversant with the mysteries of the order can attest. At the residence of A. a. Wells on Livery street within easy view of the visitors as they proceeded from the New England depot a banner was hung out with the picture of a jackass painted among reading matter so that it read nos hogans Jackass Welcomes You. An unique emblem was set out at the rooms of the Wheel club on North Main street consisting of three bicycle tires arranged so as to give an excellent representation of the triple links. A huge banner marked weLcome suspended across the street from the We ton fountain to Irving block met the eye of all who could crowd themselves into Exchange place and one of the same design was stretched from from above the entrance to the City hall to one of the elms in the green. The latter was handsomely decorated with the triple links with the letters oF. a. TO. neatly arranged in the links. When all are in the superlative degree it is not necessary to particularized but no one would help admiring the great efforts which were made to add to the majestic splendour of the Apothecaries hall building and the boWl block. The new Odd Fellows hall Irving block Lilly block A. A. a. hall and in fact every business block in the center was in holiday at tire and the owners and occupants seemed to take a pride in the great artistic triumphs. A noticeable feature of the decorations was a fair sprinkling of green flags which seemed to lend addition alarm to the other color. They were the object of much attention. The zooms of the Catholic Literary association and St Josephus Ill. A. society in the Lilly block a the Elks rooms were also splendidly decorated and a reference to this fact brought this remark from Alderman Cross chairman of the committee of arrangements whilE am much pleased with the efforts of all classes of citizens to assist us in extending a warm welcome to our visiting friends still i am not much sur prised at it. Odd fellowship is an institution of toleration and organizations founded on this principle are sure to merit the approval all true Americans regardless of class or creed. The Water shop lot where the guests were seated for dinner was a rare sight and the employees of the factory did themselves proud as waiters. Attired in their best costumes with handsome white aprons and natty headgear no wonder the guests lingered about the tables as long as time would permit. The vied walls of the factory presented an inviting aspect. Over one of the windows in the third story the letters I. OF. OF. oF were artistically arranged. At the second story a by Welcome sign could be seen from all over the grounds and over the main entrance the name of the factory was shown.

The startled hare before him springs And down the furrow speeds like wind While crisp leaves sport behind The yellow mists up one Skim or the vale on noiseless wings Above the corn.

Yes I have known people of that name but I am not sure that they are the same family you mean. I could see that a lost caste by this admission. Evidently all social distinctions paled before the pretensions of the old woman is former owners. smith Smith Who had be a talking Smith to me only a short time be fore But my memory failed me.

She smiled expansively and remarked with an air of enormous politeness Will you be good enough to tell me is any lady here de name cd Miss Gracie Lam not acquainted did de last of de name. I replied that I was so known to my intimates. She then proceeded to in form me that Mrs. Fit walter was wuss again and extremely anxious to see me if I could make it convenient to call by. I promised that I certainly would and the gracious person left Or Fit walter came by leading his little boy by the hand an exceedingly decent shiny coal black child of four or five. or. Fit walter acknowledged my acquaintance with effusion. I had of de Stiffs. been buying bananas I gave the child one. Uncle Ben who stood near by patted his head whereupon young Fit walter looked up at him with a pair of huge gleaming eyes profoundly deep and dark. Land sakes ejaculated Uncle Ben I inspected the alleged likeness Very odd I said but its so. Well you couldn't look like a better and a dearer old woman Sammy. or. Fit walter dat are a curious ting. How de chile do favor our Mammy Nelly Never see de like. ", "30": "hear your wife is ailing. I hope to get to see her to morrow morning. Re member me to her. TO will certainly do my best to exercise your commission miss Or Fit walter replied elaborately passing on. My marketing had up to this point been done in front of the shop where most of the wares were displayed. i now retired within and made the rest of my purchases in seclusion The next day I looked up Mrs fIt walter who was too ailing to come to my house but who wished to consult me as to the alternative of doing plain sewing or of giving music lessons both of which presented themselves to her mind as means of adding to her income. She showed me some of her work and she played for me a little on the piano. I decided directly in favor of the sewing although with reluctance because I could see she had a preference for the other method of earning a living. Moreover I had some work I wanted to have done immediately and which I promised to send her. On my way out I picked up an old fashioned amber type displayed in a showy gilt frame on the table on which also reposed mIlton paradiSe lost aNd longfelLow poems the picturE represented a staid sad eyed coloured woman the typical southern maMmy a turban about her head gold ear rings a gold ring on one of her hands clasped together in the composed fashion of her race How much your little boy looks like this picture i Tried. Is it your mother Yes miss wiping it with her apron of any chance dust my mother. She was a good woman if ever there was one Another resemblance flashed through my mind. I felt myself on the brick of a discovery. What was your mothers name inquired. Matilda Smith. She always kept the name of the Virginia family she came out of. She belonged to the Louisiana Levers afterwards but she never took their name. Yes Smith was her maiden name. My fathers name was Willis so she died Matilda Willis. She has been dead a good ten years now. She followed my father within four months of his death. I sat down again. I think I am not quite sure but I have an idea that a know some of your mothers relations Mrs. Fit walter. How would you feel about claiming kin They are very poor plain people. TO should be very glad to have relations near me. I often feel lonely. Mother was sold away when she was only five or six years old so that she had no distinct recollection of her people but when she was near her end she used to say she wished she had written to her mother aud tried to find out something about her that is had had a letter written. She never learned to write herself. I suppose that hindered the letters getting off. You lived in Texas Yes near San Antonio. We lived there seventeen years all my life up to that time ten years ago as I said. My mother was a right young woman when she died not more than thirty four. That was her age as near as she could calculate. If I find out anything more about your family I will let you know I said making another move. As I went away I thought to myself I believe I have found dear old Nelly lost hilda and felt a throb of satisfaction even if mother and daughter could never in this life meet face to face. I stated my errand gradually to Mam my Nelly when I went to see her the next day. I reminded her of our conversation about her daughter. of think I have found out something about her. Are she a living asked the old woman eagerly. TO think not unless I am all wrong I answered gently. Tend hardly hab expected it she said shaking her head sadly. Forty years since she war sold away. Heaps of changes comes in forty years. But you go on money. Tell me wat you hab heard. TO have seen the daughter of a woman whose name was Matilda Smith and who was sold out of the Smith family in Virginia into the Severe family in Louisiana. Dat must be my hilda. Good This Matilda Lord So it seems to me. Smith was set free by her master and afterwards married a man who was also free with whom she went to live in Texas pear San Antonio. To war near San Antonio dat A lived four year off and on. How strange that is Yon were so near that you might a most have touched each other and never knew it. I could have wept to think of it the joy of meeting so close to them and yet they had not met Where had their guardian angels been all those months Afterwards Matilda Smith died I went on. She left one daughter who is living with her husband and child in Port Royal now. She is Mrs. Fit wal ter her husband is a preacher. She has her mothers picture which looks extremely like you Mammy Nelly. Would you like to see it Indeed I wed chile the old woman answered with trembling eager ness. I brought about an interview. The relationship between Mrs Fit walter and Mammy Nelly was established beyond any reasonable doubt and the most cordial family relations were established. Mammals whole heart went out to her little great grandson. My hilda war only a trifle older when she went away. I had occasion to interview Or Fit walter on parochial matters about this time. He alluded to the discovery of pis wife is kindred. To is a series of circumstances so to speak he remarked. I could have wished my good mother. in law had lived to see this day. Instead of which she has departed to the blush unseen. Shades of the poet Gray Harpers Weekly. ", "31": "Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested at Morrison Hotel in Dublin early Thursday morning on two warrants signed by Or. Forster Chief Secretary for Ireland. One warrant charges him with inciting the intimidation of tenants from paying rent justly due and the other with intimidating tenants from taking the benefit of the Land act by applying to the Land Commission to fix a fair rent. or. Parnell was taken to Film bingham jail. His arrest has created great excitement. His arrest was determined on at a pro longed session of the Cabinet Council at which all the members of the Council except Lord Seaborne were present. Since Or. gLadstone speeches at Leeds some of the Ministerial journals in Lon don have been saying vaguely that immediate executive interference was necessary to make the Land act anything but a dead letter The arrest or Par nell however was entirely unexpected. iMmediately after the close of the cAbinet couNcil secRetary forSter left lon don for dublIn and upon his arrival there by the morning mail at a o'clock Thursday issued forthwith his warrants to the Dublin Detective Office. or Par nell was stopping at Morrison aud was to take a morning train from the King bridge station to attend the convention of the Kildare Land and Labour League. One squad of detectives fol lowed by a considerable military force went into the railway station where a crowd had gathered to see Or. Parnell off. It was thought likely that he had already boarded his train. The detectives went over the train without attracting attention and the crowd sup posed that the soldiers had been called out merely to preserve order. Meanwhile under command of Detective Superintendent Marlins six detectives went to Morrison hotel which had been carefully watched from the time Or. Parnell entered it last evening. All were in citizens clothes. Superintendent Marlins found that Parnell was still in bed and sent up word that he would Like to see him. or. Parnell re turned a message that he would see the Superintendent as soon as he was dressed and presently word came down that he was ready. Marlins took Detective Sheridan up stairs with him. or Parnell received them pleasantly and asked if he was to be arrested. Marlins handed him one of the warrants. The ink of Chief Secretary For terms signature was not yet dry. Marlins suggested that Or. Parnell go with him quietly and immediately so that there should be no chance of a disturbance. All right said Parnell and put on his hat. The two policemen escorted him to the door where a cab was waiting for bim. It was then half past nine. The cad was driven directly to Villain ham prison the other detectives following in another carriage. or. Parnell was warmly welcomed by the suspects in the prison. Nobody at the hotel and none of the bystanders on the street knew that Or. Parnell was under arrest and there was no demonstration of any kind. There was a good deal of excitement however over the news when it became known and the newspaper offices were besieged. On the chance of a disturbance the entire garrison of the city is in barracks held ready to march at any moment. It was reported that the arrest of Parnell was only a preliminary to still more vigorous action against the Land League. The Secretary of the League was interviewed shortly after the arrest. He expressed much astonishment at it and exclaimed Tet them come on we are ready for them Father Sheet Patrick BEgan and A. a. Dillon went to Paris to day. It is believed that Parr ellis speech at Wexford Sunday furnished the Governments technical justification for his arrest which the Moderate Liberals and the Conservatives approve. The Land League Executive held a long session Thursday at Morrison Messes. John Dillon Arthur Of Condor and A. a. Sullivan members of Parliament were present. or Dillon made a fiery speech and it was proposed that the League should issue an address. It is said that Or. Dillon who is A. a. for Tipperary will assume the Presidency of the League. or. Dillon said at the meeting that it was the most trying and critical moment in Ireland is history for a century. The statement that Or. Parnell had intimidated the people was false. He denied anybody to point to single speech of Or. Parnell in favor of intimidation His arrest was due to private malice. It was the duty of the nation to deal with the matter coolly and with judgment and to maintain the struggle within the law. An additional guard and two nine pounders have been stationed in the upper Castle yard. The guard at Oil main am jail has been doubled. At a meeting of the North Dublin Board of Guardians Or. Kenny the medical officer and medical attendant upon the suspects in Film bingham jail stated that he feared Or. Kettle the suspect was threatened with spinal disease and that there could not be the slightest doubt that Or. Kettles symptoms were due to his confinement. or. Kenny added that he had reported to the Government on the subject. The inhabitants of Lis more closed their shops on the reception of the news of Or. Parnell arrest.
