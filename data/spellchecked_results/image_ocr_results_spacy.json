THE CENTS.", "108": "Ethel Bruce sat on a low rock the sides of the bay windows, apparently in deep thought. \u201cA very pretty picture she made, so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittle. vines were creeping above and around her head reaching after the sunlight, while leaves, grapes, and hy- plants were growing at her feet. The gentlemen passed on, as also did the hands of the clock, but still they sat in evident study. The room was farn- faced with refined taste, and skilled hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends. It was library and sitting room combined. \u2014 Ethel's parents had always liked to have their home safe, even if other expenses had to be tracked very closely. The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks, and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of the mother were sadly missed by the daughter. The rest of the family said \u2018that Ethel took moth- er\u2019s place to them all so well, that for the time they were not great mothers,\u201d* and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to be elsewhere, rather then the actual pain said that she was having a rest in mind and body, for Ethel did not neglect anything\u201d and she kept the little mother fresh and happy, and the room so bright and cheerful, that all the family would gather around her in social life. they would first notice mother's tired look if they stayed too long,and then calling them would drive them off to the sitting room. Clay Whittle used often to come in with her to the mother\u2019s room, and these little visits were seasons of de- light to him, His mother had passed the room over into the other side. How he missed her room and her counsel, and the time spent over at the Braces, were choice minutes and great helps to him. His father was a leading politician, his sister a fashionable woman, while he him- self was a law student. The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together and on | passing out from it, she stopped a moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister. Clay she asked \u201c(Why didn\u2019t you bring Eva Dryton this evening.\u201d \u201cI prefer the company T have,\" he answered. \u201cCompany good enough I dare say, but I like to see a girl whose style of dress. Everything she wears is a year old.\u201d\u2019 \u201cWhich of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world\u2019? he answered ; joined Ethel and passed on. So on this the following morning, Ethel was trying to study out some plans for new clothes. Of course she was indig- ing over the remark, but it was true that all she had, was a year old, but she had felt that they were good enough, until now. She knew too, that all they had to live upon was her father\u2019s salary, which might have seemed large to many, but their expenses were correspondingly large, and with mother\u2019s sickness and Tom's college bills, or a little them, somebody had to confess and really deny  them- yes, and she had felt willing, and even anxious to do her share; but after over- hearing the remark of the night before, denying herself had not been so sweet. She examined the house to see if there was anything available to be made over, but returned to her low voice disheart- mood. Her father came in, and seeing something else, asked, \u2018What are your thoughts like, daughter, and what are your wishes? Speak, and if half of the kingdom is desired, it shall be yours!\u201d \u201cI thought I was queen of the world, and mistress of all evil. I desire \u2018no more than the home kingdom, with a robe of royal purple.\u201d\u2019 \u201cOr some other fashionable shade,\u2019 he said. \u2018*Frankly, Ethel, what were you thinking about?\u201d : \u201cI was wondering if there was any sur- plus money in the family treasury, that I could use for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about forty dollars. Would it help you?\u2019 \u201cYes, indeed. Just the sum I want.\u201d\u2019 The father seemed to hesitate. She spoke quickly, \u201cI don't want it if it is not here.\u201d \u201cI'll let you know at tea-time,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cWill balance accounts for the month, and rest assured, you shall have it, daughter, if father can spare it,\u2019 and seated on one knee with her arm tucked around his neck, she stroked his long beard, ca- ing. \u201cWe are not rich, Ethel.\u201d he said, \u201cbut this home is ours, and is 4 very pleasant, and an attractive one, and I have a family of whom I am both proud and grateful, There is one thing upon which I confine myself every week of my life, and is this\u2014that there are no u e bills coming in for payment not by family.", "109": "NEW AND ELEGANT STYLES I AM.

For two days members of the Senate committee on judiciary have been drop- ing in upon the President, by invitation from the chief executive. They have been dropping out as well as they knew how. They have been turning down all questions at the rate of 998 a minutes, at the same time giving the tip that the President had put them under a special tone of confidence. This morning he talked with Senators Culberson, Rayner, Bacon and Paynter, democratic members of the committee. He saw Senator Over- man, another man, yesterday, and likewise talked with Senators Clark, Dil- Williams, Piles, Warner and Borah, re- published. They all wore the solemn look the others carried with them today. The defendants asserted that the confer- were in no way related to political ques- ins, but further than that they stopped short. The best information is that the matter relates to a potential nominee whose history is pretty well known to members of the committee and that the President does not desire to have any one done an injustice by the talk that would follow any publication of the matter. Various Suggestions Offered. Various suggestions were made the day as to possible legislative the President wished to settle or taken up now. One was as to the two clause provision of the railway rate law and the understood of the President that this be amended as to prevent stock ownership by roads in companies handling really belonging to the railroads. The probability, however, to taking this up advance of the next session of and the still greater probability the committee could be brought upon any problem of that kind at time is that theory.

The President said he was sorry he could not go. Alvin Martin of Norfolk, republican na- na citizen of Virginia, asked the President today if he would not able to visit Norfolk in June, according to the invitation extended him by board of trade of that city. The President said he thought he would be able to down to Norfoik next month. No change in the Cabinet. The cabinet meeting today was a relatively short one.

The great bronze figure representing the poet, seated, and with a book in his hand, Is placed upon a block of polished granite, brought from Sweden and carved in Scotland. The fig- tree of the poet is the work of an Amer- Roman sculptor, William Couper of New York city. The statue is on the little tri- angle of grass at Connecticut avenue, 18th street and M street. The exercises began at 2:30 o'clock. A hand of the poet pulled the silk cord which broke loose the enfold- ing flags, revealing the monument. As the flags floated upward and remained Buspended in the air and the wonderful face of Longfellow, carved in bronze, was revealed, the great crowd was silent for @ moment and then broke into a spon- loud cheer. It was the climax of a great labor, occupying twelve years for its completion, and represented the con- production of thousands upon thousands of persons, from cities and the throughout the whole broad land. _ The nation did honor to the poet whose works, translated into nearly every (modern language \u2018have sung the beau- ties of American life, have told in most beautiful word pictures of the distinctly American features of the birth and up- bringing of the states of America. And as the nation has contributed its money as well as its greater sums toward the completion of the statue, so were there present men who represent the national government and men and women who as private citizens stand for the highest ideals in the communities of which they are part. The list of those who faced the statue at its opening contains the names of leaders of great foreign nations, lawyers and judges, and chief among these was Melville Weston Fuller, chief justice of the Supreme Court. He pre- sided over the ceremonies. President Unable to Attend. President Taft was compelled today to abandon the idea of attending the wedding, owing to a badly injured eye, over which he is wearing a light ban-. A pin or some other small in- sect flew into Mr. Taft's eye while he was horseback riding and after- noon. The President gave little atten-tion to the matter at the time, but yes- and his eye was much irritated. His physician thought that the glare of the bright sunlight today would be bad for the eye, and advised him not to venture out. Attorney General Wickersham, act- Ing for the President, accepted the gift on behalf of the nation. Others present were representatives from the courts of Europe and the gov- organs of American politics, citizens of Washington whose names are con- connected with every great event of the capital, and visitors whom any city would be proud to entertain. Descendants of the Poet Present. Not the least interesting feature of the building was the presence of many of the descendants of the poet. Not every living descendant was present today, but more than enough to fully represent the family of the man whose memory was honored. They were: Mrs. R. H. Dana, daughter; Mrs. H. C. leRham, second, granddaughter; R. H. Dana, Jr., grandson; H. E. L. Dana, Brandson; Miss Delia F. Dana, grand- \u00a7daughter; the Misses Moore, granddaugh- aunt; Miss M. K.

Attorney Murray, the leading counsel for the defense, is confined to his bed with pneumonia, and his associates will base this as a reason for retiring for sev- ed days. Although the court is known to be opposed to delays in this trial, it is believed, however, that he will grant the sentence. In that case the trial will not likely be resumed before next Monday.

WASHINGTON, 1, 15.\u2014Information \u2018of the formidable uprising in Korea, result- ing in the disappearance and probable death of the queen and the landing of military forces by the United States and European powers, has been received by Minister Kurino of Japan from the for- life office at Tokyo. It is quite sensa- like, indicating the landing of Mars by Russia, the United States and probably Great Britain. The latest dispatch to Minister Kurino states that a force of 300 Marines, 40 in number, has been landed. Thus far they have confined themselves to guard- ing the Russian garrison at Seoul. United States Marines were landed from the Yorktown to the number of 16. It believed also that the forces have been saved. Besides these the Japanese have a considerable force of soldiers at Seoul, who have been preserving order. The Japanese cope from Tokyo and communicate the substance of messages received from General Muira, the Japanese consul at Seoul. They are dated from the 9th to the 12th CE. It appears in these stories that the trouble had its incep- on through the queen\u2019s dislike of the newly organized military of Korea. The old soldiers had the primitive equipment of the far east, but with the progress of Japanese influence in Korea\u00bb two battal- ions of Korean troops were organized on modern methods. Each battalion num- had 600 men, armed with modern weap- guns. They were well drilled and efficient. Tai Won Kun Leads the Antiroyal Forces, When the queen showed her how to- ward these new troops, they appealed to the Tai Won Kun, a powerful chief, who has long been at ease with the queen. He accepted the leadership of the new troops, and at the head of one battalion entered the queen\u2019s palace. The native soldiers fled from the palace. They newspapers don't state specifically what became of the queen further than that she has disappeared and cannot be located. The officials are inclined to believe, how- ever, that the unofficial reports of the queen\u2019s death are true. Thegan government, the dis- patches further state, has acted quickly on the reports and has appointed a com- mission to dig into the facts. In the meantime it is repeatedly denied that the man\u2019s death, if it has occurred, was due to the illness. One report is that a priest spy killed the queen. This is not yet confirmed in the papers re- received here. The officials say that the police are an {frresponsible and violent class, and that their acts cannot be laid to the Japanese people or government. General Muira\u2019s reports also cover the work of Spanish troops in preserving or- der. These troops were stationed opposite the palace, having secured this point of contact some time since through the Ko- On government. They took no part in the attack on the palace, but after it had occurred, when the native troops were fleeing and the new battalions were en- forcing their success in capturing the pal- ace, the Chinese troops aided in prevent- ing chaos and disorder. It is probable that some deaths occurred during the me- life. Following this came the landing of United States and Russian Marines, and, as is believed, the landing of the British. Prince Pak Likely to Rule Korea. The latest assumptions are that the Tai Won Kun and the king are in control of affairs at the royal capital. The king has been the nominal ruler, but the queen has never been recognized as the real ruler. The influence of the king and the Tai Won Kunare distinctly favorable to the people. At the Roman level no word has been received from the disturbed capital. The officials are much exercised and don't doubt that the queen has met her death, although they are not ready to abandon hope. In case official confirmation is re- issued there will be such formal ceremony as is usual on the death of a sovereign. Theba will go into mourning, but there is not likely to be a funeral service, although this has been considered as a further mark of respect. Recent news from Korea makes Prince Pak, lately prime minister of that coun- try, the central figure of interest in Wash- ho. He has been here for the last few weeks and is impatiently awaiting an ex- election speech from the members of the progressive party, of which he is the lead- er, asking him to return and resume his mission of restoring the government. He is likely to be the future ruler of Korea. | | | | | | i | | |", "465": "STEUBENVILLE, O., Oct. 15.\u2014At Hone- Gale, O., Miss Buckingham, a highly skilled young lady, was met by a man named Leggett.

A telegraph was sent by the governor to Brigadier General John A. Taylor of For- rest City of the Arkansas state guard sending him to a conference at once. The meaning of the conference is that the governor desires to associate himself with the available strength of the state militia, 50 that he may act only if the situa- meeting at Hot Springs reaches a crisis where the services of the militia may be re- acquired. General Lee is expected to arrive to- day and consult with the governor.

The governor says Corbett pnd Fitzsimmons have been warned, and if they now arrive at Hot Springs bent on the mission of fighting their presence in the city or county will be considered an enemy act and will be treated accordingly. The governor says he will do everything within the scope of his power to prevent the big mill. He says that he realizes that Hot Springs is anxious to retrieve its past history, and he would like to help the city, but in this instance his duty is plain, and he will use his own dili- fence and power to do what it is his duty to do. He wou!d not like to put the state to the expense of sending several compa- ins of the state militia to Hot Springs, and he hopes the people and their leaders in the proposed fight, together with all parties concerned or interested, will not impose the necessity of ordering the militia to the scene in order to stop the fight. Concluding his interview, Gov- elect Clark said he did not want to see any blood shed as a result of the public\u2019 refusal to refrain from making preparsa- stops to fight. He merely hoped that it could be avoided. \u201c\u2018T am neither seeking nor exhibiting any tesponsibility in this matter,\u2019\u2019 he contin- bed, \u2018\u2018and will do my duty.\u201d\u2019 When questioned in reference to the proposition to change the affair into a Flove contest, Governor Clark said that he could make no distinction between glove contest and a real fight. It was fight no matter what it was called.", "493": "( Springs, Ark., Oct. 15.\u2014The law will soon be appealed to to decide whether a scientific contest between skilled boxers with soft gloves will be a violation of its provisions in the state of Arkansas.

This Evening. The Oddfellows of Waterbury were no fortunate in their selection of names: for the sake the fiftieth and day of the introduction of house: in this city, and the dedication of the: beautiful new home. Nature was un- and the weather was not all that could have been desired. The visitor: came by every train and the committees were very early abroad providing for the comfort of their guests. It was an immense un- undertaking to provide for the thousands who visited the city, but every detail had been  changed to fit and the buildings were marked with the best of order. If any of our guests have been overlooked, insulted or treated properly the fault was not of the heart, for Waterbury to ruin itself on this occasion. people of all classes co-operating with the minister to make the affair a sinry. It is estimated that there are four thousand hotels in the city and hundreds of visitors have been coming by train and trolley cars. The fact that it is a legal holiday, created by the late session of the general assembly in honor of the late president, Lin- Lin, added to the interest in the exer- life and undoubtedly increased the crowds, it being an idle day in many places.\u2019 The factories, schools and business houses are closed, and alto- tenor it is the greatest celebration Wa- ha has ever witnessed. Despite the immense crowds on the street good order was maintained. Tele- grams were received by the local author- friends from Boston, New York,Springfield and Hartford that many pirates and thieves had left for Waterbury. [t was also said that the city was over- run with the women, but up to 3 o'clock no complaints had been made to the police. The center of attraction was the visit- ing Rebekas, 400 in number. The Meriden members walked behind the band from the depot. They held a meeting in the Scovill house late this \u2018The Meriden women acted as escort to the grand patriarch. \u2018The Decorations. : The decorations were the most general and artistic ever seen in the city. Pri- city residences mixed with business houses in an effort to match each other, with the result that almost every building in the center and many on the outskirts, too, were draped with flags, and, and bannerettesof every description. The visiting soldiers must have been led to believe, when looking at the different buildings, that their father in Water- bury owned the town. And they were | right, for the place was theirs for to- l day. Some of the decorations were a l little amusing and caused the ladies to believe that those hanging them out'meant to give offense to the order, but this was not the ease, as those conver- ing with the mysteries of the order can tell. At the residence of J. B. Wells on Livery street, within easy view of the visitors as they proceeded from the New England depot, a banner was hung out with the picture of a cat painted among reading matter so that it read, \u2018\u2018Nosahogan\u2019s Jackass Welcomes You.\u201d An unique emblem was set out at the rooms of the Wheel club on North Main street, consisting of three bicycle tires arranged so as to give an excellent representation of the triple links. A huge banner marked \u2018*Welcome,\u201d\u2019 sus- and across the street from the Wel- ton fountain to Irving block, met the eye of all who could crowd themselves into Exchange place, and one the same design was stretched from from above the entrance to the City hall to one of the trees in the green. The latter was also decorated with the columns with the letters \u201cF. L. T.\u201d neatly arranged in the links. When all are in the same degree it is not necessary to particularize; but no one could help in the great efforts which were made to add to the artistic scale of the Apothecaries hall build- ing and the Bohl block. \u2018The new Odd Fellows hall, Irving block, Lilley block, G. A. R. hall, and in fact every business block in the center was in holiday at- tire and the owners and occupants seemed to take a pride in the great artistic treasures. A noticeable feature of the decorations was a fair spread of green flags, which seemed to lend ad- time alarm to the other colors. They were the object of much attention. \u2018The Story of the Catholic Literary associa- St and St Joseph's Il\u2019. A. society in the Lilley block d the other rooms were also &heavily decorated and a reference to this fact brought this remark from Alderman Cross, chairman of the committee of arrangements: ** While [am much pleased with the ef- forts of all classes of citizens to assist us in extending a warm welcome to our visiting friends, still am not much sur- se at it. Oddfellowship is an in- state of religion, and organizations founded on this principle are sure to merit the approval all true members regardless of class or race.\u201d\u2019 The auto shop lot, where the guests were seated for dinner, was a rare sight and the em- folks of the factory did themselves proud as well. dressed in their best costumes, with handsome white robes and white hats, no wonder the guests lingered about the tables as long as time would permit. \u2018The inner walls of the factory presented an inviting as- yet. Over one of the windows in the third story the letters \u201cI. O. O. F,\u201d were all ar- ranged. At the second story a bi **\u2018Welcome\u201d sign could be seen from all over the grounds, and over the main en- trance the name of the factory was shown. \u2018The reviewing stand on West Main street and the various buildings in that section also look gay in their glory, all in the touch of master hands.

Then all social dis- concerns passed before the attention of the old woman\u2019s former owners. | What? What? Who had been talk- ing Seems to me only a short time be- fore? But my memory failed me.

I has had such a pain for\u2019 (and as she spoke the old woman put her hand on her stomach), \u2018\u2018can he say he thinks my leg is affected. He had recommended some tea for me that has help me right smart. But girl is a comfort.\u201d \u2018man seemed not disturbed by the confusion of medical terms im- and in this statement; on the contrary, his expression was one of satisfaction at the tribute to his medical skill, His sister and his mother surveyed him with fond admiration. \u201cYes,\u201d Mammy Nelly repeated, as I se to go; \u2018I has all my chill\u2019en route\u2019 me in my old age\u2014all but \u2019Tilda. Now'n I go on\u2019y hear me'\u2019Tilda, I would be that easy in my min\u2019!\u201d A day or so later I was issuing forth from my own quarters, when I met a young human lady, face to face, of a certain cool and refined demeanor. She smiled politely, and remarked: with an air of enormous pride, \u201cWill you be good enough to tell me is any lady here de name, Miss Gracie?     Was not acquainted with de las\u2019 or de name.\u201d I replied that I was so known to my enemies. She then proceeded to in- form me that Mrs. Fitzwalter was welling, and extremely anxious to see me, if I could make it convenient to call by. I promised that I certainly would, and the second person left:, and, Fraser came by, leading his little boy by the hand, an exceptionally decent, shiny, coal-black child of four or five. Mr. Fitzwalter acknowledged my acquaintance with him. I had a de status.\u201d been buying babies ; I gave the child | one. Uncle Ben, who stood near by, patted his head, when young Fitz- James looked up at him with a pair of huge gleaming eyes, one deep and dark. \u2018*Landless!\u201d exclaimed Uncle Ben; I inspected the alleged evidence, \u2018Very odd,\u201d I said, \u2018\u2018 but it\u2019s so. Well, you couldn't look-like a better and a clearer old woman, Sammy. Mr. Fitzwalter, { **You are a good thing. How dee do favor our Mammy Nelly! We see de like.\u201d", "30": "{ | hear your wife is alive. I hope to get to see her to-tomorrow morning. Re- member me to her.\u201d \u2018*T will certainly do my best to exer-cise your commission, miss,\u201d ', Fitz- James replied, happily, passing on. My marketing had up to this point been done in front of the shop, where most of the ads were displayed. I now retired within, and made the rest of my purchases in silence, The next day I looked up Mrs, Fraser, who was too ill to come to my house, but who wished to consult me as to the alternative of doing plain sewing or of giving music lessons, both of which pre- dated themselves to her mind as means of adding to her income. She showed me some of her work, and she played for me a little on the \u2018\u2018stage.\u201d I decided directly in favor of the sewing, although with reluctance, because I could see she had a preference for the other method of earning 2 living. However, I had some work I wanted to have done imme- time, and which I promised to send her. On my way out I picked up an old-fashioned picture displayed in a gold gold frame on the table, on which also rested Milton\u2019s \u2018\u2018 Paradise Lost\u201d and Longfellow\u2019s poems, The picture represented a tall, sad-eyed colored woman (the typical Southern lady), a crown about her head, gold ear-rings, a gold ring on one of her hands, clasped together in the composed fashion of her race, \u2018How much your little boy looks like this picture!\u201d I asked. \u2018\u2018Is it your mother?\u201d \u2018* Yes, miss,\u201d wiping it with her apron of any chance dust\u2014\u2018\u2018 my mother. She was a good woman if ever there was one,\u201d Another resemblance flashed through my mind. I felt myself on the trail of a discovery. \u2018\u2018 What was your mother\u2019s name?\u201d [ inquired. \u2018*David smiled. She always kept the name of the Virginia family she came out of. She belonged to the Louisiana Leveres afterward, but she never took their name. Yes, it was her maiden name. My father\u2019s name was Willis; so she died Matilda Willis. She has been dead a good ten years now. She followed my father within four months of his death.\u201d I sat down again. \u2018I think\u2014I am not quite sure\u2014but I have an idea that 1 know some your mother\u2019s relations, Mrs. Fitzwalter. How would you feel about \u2018claiming kin?\u2019 They are very poor, plain people.\u201d \u201c*T should be very glad to have rela- ing near me. I often feel lonely. Mother was sold away when she was only five or six years old, so that she had no distinct opinion of her people ; but when she was near her end, she used to say she wished she had written to her mother, and tried to find out something about her; that is, had had a letter written. She never learned to write herself. I suppose that hin- and the letters getting off.\u201d \u2018\u00a9 You lived in Texas?\u201d \u201cYes; near San Antonio. We lived there seventeen years\u2014all my life up to that time ; ten years ago, as I said. My mother was a right young woman when she died, not more than thirty-four. That was her age as near as she could get.\u201d\u2019 \u201cIf I find out anything more about your family, I will let you know,\u201d I said, making another move. As I went away, I thought to myself, \u2018\u2018I believe I have found dear old Nelly\u2019s lost \u2019Tilda;\u201d and [ felt a sort of satisfaction, even if mother and daughter could never in this life meet face to face. I stated my point gradually to Mam- my aunt when I went to see her the next day. I reminded her of our con- visit about her daughter. \u2018\u2018f think I have found out something about her.\u201d \u2018\u2018Are she a-in\u2019?\u201d asked the old wo- man, eagerly. \u2018\u201cT think not, unless I am all wrong,\u201d I answered, gently. \u201cT'hardly had expected it,\u201d she said, shaking her head, sadly. \u2018\u2018Forty years since she warp\u2019 away. That of changes comes in forty years. But you go on, boy. Tell me what you can here.\u201d \u201cT have seen the daughter of a wo- man whose name was Matilda Smith, and who was sold out of the white fam- mill in Virginia into the Levere family in Louisiana.\u201d \u201ca must\u2019 be my \u2018wife. Good This is Go\u2019!\u201d \u201cSo it seems to me. Sarah was set free by her master, and afterward married a man who was also free, with whom she went to live in Texas, near San Antonio.\u201d \u201cat war near San Antonio. J is four year, off an\u2019 on.\u201d \u2018How strange that is! You were so near that you might almost have touched each other, and never knew it.\u201d I could have come to think of it\u2014the joy of meeting so close to them, and yet they had not met! Where had their guardian angels been all those months? \u201cAfterward David just died,\u201d I went on. \u2018\u2018She left one daughter, who is living with her husband and child in Port Royal now. She is Mrs. Fitzwal- Jones; her husband is a preacher. She has her mother\u2019s picture, which looks extremely like you, Mammy Nelly. Would you like to see it?\u201d \u2018*Indeed I did, sir,\u201d the old wo- man answered, with great eager-ness. I brought about an interview. The relationship between him, James and Mammy Nelly was established be- beyond any reasonable doubt, and the most formal family relations were established. Mammy\u2019s whole heart went out to her little great-grandson. \u201cMy \u2019did war on\u2019y a little older when she went away.\u201d I had occasion to interview Mr, Fitz- James on other matters about this time. He awoke to the discovery of his wife\u2019s bones. \u201cIt is a series of circumstances, so to speak,\u201d he remarked. \u2018I could have wished my good mother. in-law had lived to see this day. Instead of which, she has departed to the blush unseen.\u201d Shades of the poet Gray!--Harper's Weekly.", "31": "Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested at Morrison\u2019s Hotel, in Dublin, early Tuesday morning on two warrant signed by Mr. Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland. One warrant charges him with increasing the opposition of tenants from paying rents due, and the other with intimidating tenants from taking the benefit of the Land act, by applying to the Land Commission to fix a fair rent. Mr. Parnell was taken to Kilmainham jail. His arrest has created great excitement. His arrest was determined on a pro- longed session of the Cabinet Council, at which all the members of the Council except Lord Melbourne were present. Since Mr. Gladstone\u2019s speeches at Leeds some of the Ministerial journals in Lon- don have been saying vaguely that im- mere executive interference was nec- er to make the Land act anything but a dead letter, The arrest or Par- din, however, was entirely unexpected. Immediately after the close of the Cabi- net Council Secretary Forster left Lon- don for Dublin, and upon his arrival there by the morning mail at 8 o\u2019clock sharp, issued with his warrant to the Dublin Detective Office. Now, Par- Lee was stopping at Morrison\u2019s, and was to take a morning train from the Kildare station to attend the con- convention of the Kildare Land and Labor League. One squad of detectives, fol- owed by a superior military force, went into the railway station, where, a crowd had gathered to see Mr. Parnell off. It was thought likely that he had already boarded his train. The detec- men went over the train without at- least attention, and the crowd sup- posed that the soldiers had been called out merely to preserve order. Meanwhile, under command of Detec-tive Superintendent Mallins, six detec- ins went to Morrison\u2019s hotel, which had been carefully watched from the time Mr. Parnell entered it last evening. All were in citizen\u2019s clothes. Superin- Agent Mallins found that Parnell was in bed, and sent up word that he would like to see him. Mr. Parnell re- turned a message that he would see the Superintendent as soon as he was dressed, and presently word came down that he was ready. Mallins took Deteec- like Sheridan up stairs with him. There, Parnell received them personally, and asked if he was to be arrested. Mallins handed him one of the cards. The ink of Chief Secretary Forster's signa- mark was not yet dry. Mallins suggested that Mr. Parnell go with him quietly and immediately, so that there should be no chance of a disturbance. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Parnell, and put on his hat. The two policemen escorted him to the door, where a cab was wait- ing for him. It was then half past nine. The car was driven directly to Kilmain- the prison, the other detectives follow- ing in another carriage. Mr. Parnell was warmly welcomed by the suspects in the prison. Nobody at the hotel and none of the others on the street knew that Mr. Parnell was under arrest, and there was no demonstration of any kind. There was a good deal of excite-ment, however, over the news when it became known, and the newspaper offices were besieged. On the chance of a disturbance, the entire garrison of the city is in barracks, held ready to march any moment. It was reported that the arrest of Parnell was only a prelimi- link to still more vigorous action against the Land League. The Secre- Leader of the League was interviewed shortly after the arrest. He expressed much astonishment at it, and exclaimed, \u201cLet them come on; we are ready for them!\u201d Father Sheehy, Patrick Egan and V. B. Dillon went to Paris to-day. It is believed that Parrell\u2019s speech at Wexford has furnished the Govern- elect\u2019s technical justification for his ar- rest, which the Moderate Liberals and the Conservatives approve. The Land League Executive held a long session held at Morrison\u2019s, Messrs. John Dillon, Arthur O\u2019Connor and A. M. Sullivan, members of Parlia- West, were present. Here, Dillon made a fiery speech, and 1t was proposed that the Leagne should issue an address. It is said that Mr. Dillon, who is M. P. for life, will assume the Presidency of the League. Mr. Dillon said at the meeting that it was the most trying and critical moment in Ireland\u2019s history for a century. The statement that Mr. Parnell had intimi- dated the people was false. He dared anybody to point the speech of Mr. Parnell in favor of prohibition, His arrest was due to private law. It was the duty of the nation to deal with the mattery and with judgment, and to maintain the struggle within the law. An additional guard and two nine- pounder have been stationed in the upper Castle yard. The guard at Kil- na jail has been doubled. At a meeting of the North Dablin Board of Guardians, Mr. Kenny, the medical officer and medical attendant upon the suspects in Kilmainham jail, stated that he feared Mr. Kettle, the suspect, was threatened with spinal disease, and that there could not be the slightest doubt that Mr. Kettle\u2019s actions were due to his condition. Mr. Kenny added that he had reported to the Government on the subject. The inhabitants of London closed their shops on the reception of the news of Mr. Parnell\u2019s arrest.", "32": "SALISBURY HOTEL, ULMAN & BRO., Paris.
