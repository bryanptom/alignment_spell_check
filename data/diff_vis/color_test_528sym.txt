If I thought we were here to reaffirm the Dingle law I would pack my grip and go home at once for I am not required by my oath as a senator to tic pate in such a farce. He Labels the Enemy. It was rumoured continued the Minnesotan that those who promised revision downward would not be able to carry out their promise. He didn't believe that but thought when the bill was complete it would be a fair reduction. The enemy of protection today he declared is the man who having the power abuses it. You may not heed the clamour today but in two years you will be driven to it and will learn that the people are determined to have it. Look Two Years Ahead If you don't do it now you will find that in two years the enemies of protection will revise the tariff. You will either redeem that promise now or the people will arise in their wrath and strike down the white principle for which we re publicans contend.

   <br/>It was Senator Clapp of Minnesota who read a lecture to Senator Aldrich, chair- man of the finance committee, and the other high protectionists in the Senate today. He joined the other republican insurgent-revisionists in warning Mr. Ald- rich that unless the promise of the plat- form of 1908 was kept the tariff would be revised by the enemies of protection two years hence. Mr. Clapp started off by asking: "Where are we?" and saying that some mighty strange doctrines had been propounded in the Senate in the last few days. He said he was a protectionist, but favored the promised revision downward. It would be impossible in his opinion for the democrats and "progressive" repub- licans to join forces all along the line, owing to the difference in their principles. He appealed to the high-protection ad- vocates to do the trick. "Howling Farce," Says He. He ridiculed the idea that the platform of the republican party last fall did not declare for revision downward in spirit and was not so understood. "If it meant that we were to stand by the Dingley law," he shouted, "then we are confronted by the ridiculous spectacle of the chief executive calling us in special session to reaffirm for all time something that doesn't need reaffirming. If it did not mean revision downward the whole thing is a farce. "If I thought we were here to reaffirm the Dingley law, I would pack my grip and go home at once, for I am not re- quired by my oath as a senator to par- ticipate in such a farce." He Labels "the Enemy." It was rumored, continued the Minne- sotan, that those who promised revision downward would not be able to carry out their promise. He didn't believe that, but thought when the bill was complete it would be a fair reduction. "The enemy of protection today," he declared, "is the man who, having the power, abuses it. You may not heed the clamor today, but in two years you will be driven to it and will learn that the people are determined to have it. Look Two Years Ahead! "If you don't do it now you will find that in two years the enemies of pro- tection will revise the tariff. You will either redeem that promise now or the people will arise in their wrath and strike down the whole principle for which we re- publicans contend." <br/><br/>***Errors:***<br/>***No Correction***: Homoglyphic: 4  Non-Homoglyphic: 55  Major: 2<br/>
