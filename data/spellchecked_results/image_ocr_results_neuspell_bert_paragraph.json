REE CES .", "108": "Ethel Bruce sat on a low rockerin the recess of the bay windows , apparently in deep thought . . A very pretty picture she made , so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittle . Ivies were creeping above and around her head reaching after the sunlight , while lilies , geraniums , and by - acinths were blooming at her feet . The gentlemen passed on , as also did the hands of the clock , but still Ethel sat in evident study . The room was fair - rushed with cultured taste , and skillful hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends . It was library and sitting room combined . despite Ethel ' s parents had always striven to have their home attractive , even if other expenses had to be curtailed very closely . The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks , and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of the mother were sadly missed by the daughter . The rest of the family said that that Ethel took many - her ' s place to them all so well , that for the time they were not great losers , , * and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to be elsewhere , rather then from actual pain said that she was having a rest in mind and body , for Ethel did not neglect anything else and she kept the little mother fresh and dainty , and the room so bright and cheery , that all the family would gather around her in social glee . Ethel would first notice mother ' s tired look if they stayed too long , and pleasantly chiding them would drive them off to the sitting room . Clay Whittle used often to come in with Hal to the mother ' a room , and these little visits were seasons of de - light to him , His mother had passed the portals over into the other side . How he missed her room and her counsel , and the time spent over at the Braces , were choice minutes and great tools to him . His father was a leading politician , his sister a fashionable woman , while he him - self was a law student . The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together and on | passing out from it , she stopped a moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister . Clay she asked me ( Why did to t you bring Eva Dryton this evening . , should I prefer the company T have , \" he answered . no Company good enough I dare say , but I like to see a girl handsome style of dress . Everything she wears is a year old . regard here Bin Which of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world , ? he answered ; joined Ethel and passed on . So on this the following morning , Ethel was trying to study out some plans for new clothes . Of course she was index - bent over the remark , but it was true that all she had , was a year old , but she had felt that they were good enough , until now . She knew too , that all they had to live upon was her father ' as salary , which might have seemed large to many , but their expenses were correspondingly large , and with mother ' s s and Tom ' s college bills , or a part them , somebody had to economize and really deny them - selves , and she had felt willing , and even anxious to do her share ; but after over - hearing the remark of the night before , denying herself had not been so sweet . She examined the closets to see if there was anything available to be made over , but returned to her low rocker disheart - ened . Her father came in , and seeing something amiss , asked , please What are your thoughts like , daughter , and what are your wishes ? Speak , and if half of the kingdom is desired , it shall be yours ! you here I thought I was queen of the film , and mistress of all Lsurvey . I desire and no more than the home kingdom , with a robe of royal purple . should Hertfordshire versus Or some other fashionable shade , , he said . \" * Frankly , Ethel , what were you thinking about ? please : . I was wondering if there was any sur - plus money in the family treasury , that I could use for myself , and she said . should I think about forty dollars . Would it help you ? across and Yes , indeed . Just the sum I want . answer should The father seemed to hesitate . Ethel spoke quickly , should I do not want it if it is needed elsewhere . sons \u201c I ' ll let you know at tea - time , , here he said . \u201c Will balance accounts for the month , and rest assured , you shall have it , daughter , if father can spare it , seated and seated on one knee with her arm twinned around his neck , she stroked his manly beard , co - ressingly . \" We are not rich , Ethel . thus he said , . but this home is ours , and is 4 very pleasant , and an attractive one , and I have a family of whom I am both proud and thankfal , There is one thing upon which I can late myself every week of my life , and it this way that there are no you e bills coming in for payment coutmeciod by family .", "109": "NEW AND ELEGANT STYLES SMITH AM .

For two days members of the Senate committee on judiciary have been drop- ping in upon the President, by invitation from the chief executive. They have been dropping out as noiselessly as they knew how. They have been turning down all questions at the rate of 998 a minutes, at the same time giving the tip that the President had put them under a special inhibition of confidence. This morning he talked with Senators Culberson, Rayner, Bacon and Paynter, democratic members of the committee. He saw Senator Over- man, another democrat, yesterday, and likewise talked with Senators Clark, Dil- lingham, Piles, Warner and Borah, re- publicans. They all wore the solemn look the democrats carried with them today. The democrats asserted that the confer- ence in no way related to political ques- tions, but further than that they stopped short. The best information is that the matter relates to a judgeship nominee whose history is pretty well known to members of the committee and that the President does not desire to have any one done an injustice by the talk that would follow any publication of the matter. Various Suggestions Offered. Various suggestions were made the day as to possible legislative the President wished to settle or taken up now. One was as to the ities clause provision of the railway rate law and the understood of the President that this be amended as to prevent stock ownership by roads in companies handling really belonging to the railroads. The probability, however, to taking this up advance of the next session of and the still greater improbability the committee could be brought upon any problem of that kind at time dispels that theory. Invitations for the President. Senator Paynter of Kentucky asked President today to attend the meeting the Kentucky Retail Grocers\u2019 at Frankfort the 12th of this month. The President said he was sorry he could not go. Alvin Martin of Norfolk, republican na- tional committeeman of Virginia, asked the President today if he would not able to visit Norfolk in June, according to the invitatiori extended him by board of trade of that city.

The great bronze figure representing the poet, seated, and with a book in his hand, Is placed upon a block of Bonacord granite, brought from Sweden and carved in Scotland. The fig- ure of the poet is the work of an Amer- fean sculptor, William Couper of New York city. The statue is on the little tri- angle of grass at Connecticut avenue, 18th street and M street. The exercises began at 2:30 o'clock. A grandchild of the poet pulled the silken cord which broke loose the enfold- ing flags, revealing the monument. As the flags floated upward and remained Buspended in the air and the wonderful face of Longfellow, carved in bronze, was revealed, the great throng was silent for @ moment and then broke into a spon- taneous cheer. It was the climax of a great labor, occupying twelve years for fts completion, and represented the con- fributions of thousands tpon thousands eof persons, from cities and hamlets Rhroughout the whole broad land. _ The nation did honor to the poet whose fworks, transplanted into nearly every (modern language \u2018have sung the beau- ties of American life, have told in most beautiful word pictures of the distinctly American features of the birth and up- bringing of the states of America. And as the nation has contributed its mites as well as its greater sums toward the completion of the statue, so were there present men who represent the national government and men and women who as private citizens stand for the highest ideals in the communities of which they are part. The list of those who faced the statue at its unvefling contains the names of ambassadors of great foreign nations, Jawmakers and judges, and chief among these was Melville Weston Fuller, chief justice of the Supreme Court. He pre- sided over the ceremonies. President Unable to Attend. President Taft was compelled today to abandon the idea of attending the unveiling, owing to a badly inflamed eye, over which he is wearing a light ban- duce A gnat or some other small in- sect flew into Mr. Taft's eye while he was horseback riding Wednesday after- noon. The President gave little atten- tion to the matter at the time, but yes- terday his eye was much irritated. His physician thought that the glare of the bright sunlight today would be bad for the eye, and advised him not to venture dut. Attorney General Wickersham, act- Ing for the President, accepted the gift dn behalf of the nation. Others present were representatives frum the courts of Europe and the gov- srnments of American republics, citizens of Washington whose names are con- nected with every great event of the capital, and visitors whom any city would be proud to entertain. Descendants of the Poet Present. Not the least interesting feature of the bnveiling wag the presence of many of the descendants of the poet. Not every ving descendant was present today, but more than enough to fully represent the family of the man whose memory was honored. They were: Mrs. R. H. Dana, daughter; Mrs. H. C. leRham, second, granddaughter; R. H. Dana, jr., grandson; H. E. L. Dana, Brandson; Miss Delia F. Dana, grand- \u00a7aughter; the Misses Thorp, granddaugh- vers; Miss M. K.

SAN FRANcIScO, Oct. 15.\u2014The trial ot Theodore Durant for the murder of Blanche Lamont did not go on yesterday. So many of the jurors are business men and this being collection day the court ad- journed until today. It is likely that the court will take a further adjournment. Attorney Duprey, the leading counsel for the defense, is confined to his bed with rheumatism, and his associates will base this as a reason for continuance for sev- eral days. Although the court is known to be opposed to delays in this trial, it is believed, however, that he will grant the continuance. In that case the trial will not likely be resumed before next Monday. In the meantime Theodore Durant re- mains in his cell, never leaving it for the customary exercising in the corridors. It is said that he is becoming exceedingly irritable. Since ho finished his testimony in Judge Murphx\u2019s court the has lost considerable vivacity, and instead of being careless and indifferent he is se- rious and troubled. For the first time since his arrest the medical student seemed impressed with the proper idea of his terrible position. At last it has dawned on him that he may be convicted, and as he realizes the chain of circumstances against him has become much depressed. Attorney Dickinson, for Durant, remarked that he thought the defense would be able to put in the balance of its testimony in two days or less. Then the prosecution will put its witnesses in rebuttal. District At- torney Barnes says he will handle them rapidly, but Dickinson is proparing to cross question witnesses at length, and on that account it need create no surprise if another week is devoted to the work Although Captain of Detectives Lees busily engaged in the trial of Durant the murder of Blanche Lamont, he is overlooking the Minnie Williams case, but is still gathering evidence to be when the trial of that case is begun.

WASHINGTON, Oct, 15.\u2014Information \u2018of the formidable uprising in Korea, result- ing in the disappearance and probable death of the queen and the landing of military forces by the United States and European powers, has been received by Minister Kurino of Japan from the for- eign office at Tokyo. It is quite sensa- tional, indicating the landing of marines by Russia, the United States and probably Great Britain. The latest dispatch to Minister Kurino states that a force of Russian marines, 40 in number, has been landed. Thus far they have confined themselves to guard- ing the Russian legation at Seoul. United States marines were landed from the Yorktown to the number of 16. Itis belicved also that British marines have been Janded. Besides these the Japanese have a considerable force of soldiers at Seoul, who have been preserving order. The dispatches cope from Tokyo and communicate the substance of dispatches received from General Muira, the Japanese envoy at Seoul. They are dated from the 9th to the 12th inst. It appears in these dispatches that the trouble had its incep- tion through the queen\u2019s dislike of the newly organized soldiery of Korea. The old soldiers had the primitive equipment of the far east, but with the progress of Japanese influence in Korea\u00bb two battal- ions of Korean troops were organized on modern methods. Each battalion num- bered 600 men, armed with modern weap- ons. They were well drilled and officered. Tai Won Kun Leads the Antiroyal Forces, When the queen showed her disfavor to- ward theso new troops, they appealed to the Tai Won Kun, a powerful chief, who has long been at enmity with the queen. He accepted the leadership of the new troops, and at the head of one battalion entered the queen\u2019s palace. The native soldiers fled from the palace. Tho Tokyo dispatches do not state specifically what became of the queen further than that she has disappeared and cannot be located. The officials are inclined to believe, how- ever, that the unofficial reports of the queen\u2019s death are truo. Yhe Japanese government, the dis- patches further state, has acted quickly on the reports and has appointed a com- mission to inquire into the facts. In the meantime it is emphatically denied that the quceen\u2019s death, if it has occurred, was due to the Japanese. One report is that a Japanese Soshi killed the queen. This is not yet confirmed in the dispatches re- ceived here. The officials say that the Soshi are an {frresponsible and lawless class, and that their acts cannot be laid to the Japanese people or government. General Muira\u2019s reports also cover the work of Japanese troops in preserving or- der. These treops were stationed opposite the palace, having secured this point of vantage some time since through the Ko- rean government. They took no part in the attack on the palace, but after it had occurred, when tho native troops were fleeing and the new battalions were en- forcing their success in capturing the pal- ace, the Japanese troops aided in prevent- ing bloodshed and disorder. It is probable that some deaths occurred during the me- lee. Following this came the landing of United States and Russian marines, and, as is believed, the landing of the British. Prince Pak Likely to Rule Korea. The latest indications are that the Tai Won Kun and the king are in control of affairs at the Korean capital. The king has been the nominal ruler, but the queen has heretofore been recognized as the real ruler. The influence of the king and the Tai Won Kunare distinctly favorable to the Japanese. At the Korean legation no word has been received from the disturbed capital. The officials are much exercised and do not doubt that the queen has met her death, although they are not ready to abandon hope. In case official confirmation is re- ceived there will be such formal ceremony as is usual on the death of a sovereign. Tho legation will go into mourning, but there is not likely to be a funeral service, although this has been considered as a further mark of respect. Recent news from Korea makes Prince Pak, lately prime minister of that coun- try, the central figure of interest in Wash- ington. He has been here for the last faw weeks and is impatiently awaiting an ex- pected summons from the members of the progressive party, of which he is the lead- er, asking him to return and resume his mission of reforming the government. He is likely to be the future ruler of Korea. | | | | | | i | | |", "465": "STEUBENVILLE, O., Oct. 15.\u2014At Hone- Gale, O., Miss Buckingham, a highly utable young lady, was met by a man named Leggett.

Mexico Is Now Spoken of as the Pro- spective Battleground. LITTLE Rock, Oct. 15.\u2014Governor Clark furnished fresh evidence of his determina- tion to prevent the Corbett- Fitzsimmons fight at Hot Springs or in Arkansas. A telegram was sent by the governor to Brigadier General John A. Taylor of For- rest City of the Arkansas state guard summoning him to a conference at once. The meaning of the conference is that the governor desires to acquaint himself with the available strongth of the state militia, 50 that he may act knowingly if the situa- tion at Hot Springs reaches a crisis where the services of the militia may be re- quired. General Tayler is expected to arrive to- day and consuit with the governor. According to the offers contained in telegrams and letters received at the ex- ecutive office, Governor Clark estimates that the services of 10,000 men are at his fisposal for the purpose of putting down the fight if needed. These offers como from all parts of the state. Clark Determined to Prevent the Fight, A vigorous determination to prevent the fight is plainly discernable in the sig- nificant proceedings at the executive office. Indeed Governor Clark was more emphat- ic than ever in saying that the fight would net be allowed to come off in Arkansas. He goes so far as to say that if the affair pecurs as advertised at Hot Springs he tvould resign and try to find an office that he could run. The governor says Corbett pnd Fitzsimmons have been warned, and if they now arrive at Hot Springs bent on the mission of fighting their presence in the city or county will be considered an overt act and will be treated accordingly. The governor says he will do everything within the scope of his power to prevent the big mill. He says that he realizes that Hot Springs is anxious to retrieve its past misfortunes, and he would like to help the city, but in this instance his duty is plain, and he will use his utmost dili- fence and power to do what it is his duty to do. He wou!d not like to put the state to the expense of sending several compa- nies of the state militia to Hot Springs, and he hopes the principals and their backers in the proposed fight, together with all parties concerned or interested, tvill not impose the necessity of ordering the militia to the scene in order to stop the fight. Concluding his interview, Gov- eprnor Clark said he did not want to see any blood shed as a result of the pugilists\u2019 refusal to refrain from making preparsa- tions to fight. He sincerely hoped that it tvould be avoided. \u201c\u2018T am neither seeking nor slighting any tesponsibility in this matter,\u2019\u2019 he contin- bed, \u2018\u2018and will do my duty.\u201d\u2019 When questioned in reference to the proposition to change the affair into a Flove contest, Governor Clark said that bes could make no distinction between glove contest and a prizo fight. It was fight no matter what it was called.", "493": "HHot Sprines, Ark., Oct. 15.\u2014The law will soon be appealed to to decide whether a scientific contest between skilled boxers with soft gloves will be a violation of its provisions in the state of Arkansas.

The Oddfellows of Waterbury were no fortunate in their selection of ada: for the observance ofthe fiftieth anni versary of the introduction ofthe orde: in this city, and the dedication of thei: beautiful new home. Nature was un- and the weather was not all thai could have been desired. The visitor: came by every train anc the committees were very early abroad providing for the comfort of their guests. It was an immense un- dertaking to provide for the thousands who visited the city, but every detail had been  arrangec to anicety and the procedings were marked with the best of order. If any of our guests have been overlooked, slighted or treated ungraciously the fault was not of the heart, for Waterbury to outdo itself on this occasion. people of all classes co-operating with the committeer to make the affair a suc cess. It is estimated that there are four thousand Oddfellows in the city and hundreds of visitors have been coming by train and trolley cars. The fact that it is a legal holiday, created by the late session of the general assembly in honor of the martyred president, Lin- coln, added to the interest in the exer- cises and undoubtedly increased the crowds, it being an idle day in many places.\u2019 The factories, schools and business houses are closed, and alto- gether it is the gaeatest celebration Wa- terbury has ever witnessed. Despite the immense crowds on the street good order was maintained. Tele- grams were received by the local author- ities from Boston, New York,Springfield and Hartford that many pickpockets and thieves had left for Waterbury. [t was also said that the city was over- run with lewd women, but up to 3 o'clock no complaints had been made to the police. The center of attraction was the visit- ing Rebekas, 400 in number. The Meriden members paraded behind the band from the depot. They held a meeting in the Scovill house late this \u2018The Meriden encampment acted as escort to the grand patriarch. \u2018The Decorations. : The decorations were the most general and artistic ever seen in the city. Pri- vate residences vied with business houses in an effort to outdo each other, with the result that almost every building in the center and many on the outskirts, too, were resplendent with flags, bunting, 1and bannerettesof every description. The visiting Oddfellows must have been led to believe, when looking at the different buildings, that their brethren in Water- bury owned the town. And they were | right, for the place was theirs for to- l day. Some of the decorations were a l little amusing and caused the unitiated to believe that those hanging them out 'meant to give offense to the urder, but this was not the ease, as those conver- sunt with the mysteries of the order can attest. At the residence of J. B. Wells on Livery street, within easy view of the visitors as they proceeded from the New England depot, a banner was hung out with the picture of a jackass painted among reading matter so that it read, \u2018\u2018Nosahogan\u2019s Jackass Welcomes You.\u201d An unique emblem was set out at the rooms of the Wheel club on North Main street, consisting of three bicycle tires arranged so as to give an excellent representation of the triple links. A huge banner marked \u2018*Welcome,\u201d\u2019 sus- pended across the street from the Wel- ton fountain to Irving block, met the eye of all who could crowd themselves into Exchange place, and one ofthe same design was stretched from from above the entrance to the City hall to one of the elms in the green. The latter was handsomely decorated with the triplelinks with the letters \u201cF. L. T.\u201d neatly arranged in ihe links. When all are in the superlative degree it is not necessary to particularize; but no one eould help admiring the great efforts which were made to add to the majestic splendor of the Apothecaries hall build- ing and the Bohl block. \u2018The new Odd Fellows hall, Irving block, Lilley block, G. A. R. hall, and in fact every business block in the center was in holiday at- tire and the owners and occupants seemed to take a pride in the great artistic triumphs. A noticeable feature of the decorations was a fair sprinkling of green flags, which seemed to lend ad- dition alarm to the other colors. They were the object of much attention. \u2018The zooms of the Catholic Literary associa- tion and St Joseph's Il\u2019. A. society in the Lilley block d the Elks rooms were also &plendidly decorated and a reference to this fact brought this remark from Alderman Cross, chairman of the committee of arrangements: ** While [am much pieased with the ef- forts of all classes of citizens to assist us in extending a warm welcome to our visiting friends, still Iam not much sur- prised at it. Oddfellowship is an in- stitution of toleration, and organizations founded on this principle are sure to merit the approval all true Americans regardless of class or creed.\u201d\u2019 The Wateh shop lot, where the guests were seated for dinner, was a rare sight and the em- ployes of the factory did themselves proud as waiters. Attired in their best costomes, with handsome white aprons and natty headgear, no wonder the guests lingered about the tables as long as time would permit. \u2018The ivied walls of the factory presented an inviting as- pect. Over one of the windows in the third story the letters \u201cI. O. O. F,\u201d were artistically ar- ranged. At the second story a bi **\u2018Welcome\u201d sign could be seen from all over the grounds, and over the main en- trance the name of the factory was shown. \u2018The reviewing stand on West Main street and the various buildings in that section also look gay in their finery, all showin the touch of master hands.

And fear creeps through his trembling veins As the rising sua dilates in red, And as each mountain's head His crimson hues adorn, John quakes to think the coming rains May swamp his corn. Still high o\u2019erhead the waning moon Reveals a patch of clearing blue, And hope comes peering through With Luna\u2019s welcome horn, That yet a favoring sky at noon Will bless the corn. The changeful sun, erst steeped in fire, Behold, pours fourth rich amber streams That quench with bright joy-gleams The frowns his face had worn, For Heaven and he may now conspire See, o'er the east a golden mantle\u2019s flung! Fast move the mists from out the north, And as the winds come forth, To little shreds are torn The great cloud-masses that o\u2019erhung The golden corn. To save the corn. And lo! the wakened crows soar high ; How arrow-straight they upward fly O'er bits of dappled sky, And leave the earth forlorn ! While clouds of lazy rooks float by The tempting corn.' ' What smiles sleep in the farmer's eyes ! To-day he'll \u201cin\u201d that precious grain, For he knows the dreaded rain Such bodings dare not scorn. So, whistling thanks to sun and skies.

Evidentiy all social dis- tinctions paled before the pretensions of the old woman\u2019s former owners. | Smith? Smith? Who had beea talk- ing Smith to me only a short time be- fore?

Now ' ef I cud on\u2019y hear sumfin ob \u2019Tilda, I wud be dat easy in my min\u2019!\u201d A day or so later I was issuing forth from my own portals, when I met a young African lady, face to face, of a certain decorous and dignified demeanor. She smiled expansively, and remarked: with an air of enormous politeness, \u201cWill you be good enough to tell me is any lady here de name cb Miss Gracie ?     Lam not acquainted wid de las\u2019 ob de name.\u201d I replied that I was so known to my intimates. She then proceeded to in- form me that Mrs. Fitzwalter was wuss agin, and extremely anxious to see me, if I could make it convenient to call by. I promised that I certainly would, and the gracious person lef:, Mr, Fitzwalter came by, leading his little boy by the hand, an exceedingly decent, shiny, coal-black child of four or five. Mr. Fitzwalter acknowledged my acquaintance with effusion. I had ob de Smiffs.\u201d been buying bananas ; I gave the child | one. Uncle Ben, who stood near by, patted his head, whereupon young Fitz- walter looked up at him with a pair of huge gleaming eyes, profoundly deep and dark. \u2018*Land sakes !\u201d ejaculated Uncle Ben; I inspected the alleged likeness, \u2018Very odd,\u201d I said, \u2018\u2018 but it\u2019s so. Well, you couldn't look-like a better and a dearer old woman, Sammy. Mr. Fitzwalter, { **dat are a cur\u2019ous ting. How de chile do favor our Mammy Nelly! Neber see de like.\u201d", "30": "{ | hear your wife is ailing. I hope to get to see her to-morrow morning. Re- member me to her.\u201d \u2018*T will certainly do my best to exer- cise your commission, miss,\u201d Mr, Fitz- walter replied, elaborately, passing on. My marketing had up to this point been done in front of the shop, where most of the wares were displayed. I now retired within, and made the rest of my purchases in seclusion, The next day I looked up Mrs, Fitzwalter, who was too ailing to come to my house, but who wished to consult me as to the alternative of doing plain sewing or of giving music lessons, both of which pre- sented themselves to her mind as means of adding to her income. She showed me some of her work, and she played for me a little on the \u2018\u2018pyano.\u201d I decided directly in favor of the sewing, although with reluctance, because I could see she had a preference for the other method of earning 2 living. Moreover, I had some work I wanted to have done imme- diately, and which I promised to send her. On my way out I picked up an old-fashioned ambrotype displayed in a showy gilt frame on the table, on which also reposed Milton\u2019s \u2018\u2018 Paradise Lost\u201d and Longfellow\u2019s poems, The picture represented a staid, sad-eyed colored woman (the typical Southern mammy), a turban about her head, gold ear-rings, a gold ring on one of her hands, clasped together in the composed fashion of her race, \u2018How much your little boy looks like this picture!\u201d I eried. \u2018\u2018Is it your mother?\u201d \u2018* Yes, miss,\u201d wiping it with her apron of any chance dust\u2014\u2018\u2018 my mother. She was a good woman if ever there was one,\u201d Another resemblance flashed through my mind. I felt myself on the brivk of a discovery. \u2018\u2018 What was your mother\u2019s name ?\u201d [ inquired. \u2018*Matilda Smith. She always kept the name of the Virginia family she came out of. She belonged to the Louisiana Leveres afterward, but she never took their name. Yes, Smith was her maiden name. My father\u2019s name was Willis; so she died Matilda Willis. She has been dead a good ten years now. She followed my father within four months of his death.\u201d I sat down again. \u2018I think\u2014I am not quite sure\u2014but I have an idea that 1 know some ofyour mother\u2019s relations, Mrs. Fitzwalter. How would you feel about \u2018claiming kin?\u2019 They are very poor, plain people.\u201d \u201c*T should be very glad to have rela- tions near me. I often feel lonely. Mother was sold away when she was only five or six years old, so that she had no distinct recollection of her people ; but when she was near her end, she used to say she wished she had written to her mother, aud tried to find out something about her; that is, had had a letter written. She never learned to write herself. I suppose that hin- dered the letters getting off.\u201d \u2018\u00a9 You lived in Texas ?\u201d \u201cYes; near San Antonio. We lived there seventeen years\u2014all my life up to that time ; ten years ago, as I said. My mother was a right young woman when she died, not more than thirty-four. That was her age as near as she could caleulate.\u201d\u2019 \u201cIf I find out anything more about your family, I will let you know,\u201d I said, making another move. As I went away, I thought to myself, \u2018\u2018I believe I have found dear old Nelly\u2019s lost \u2019Tilda;\u201d and [ felt a throb of satisfaction, even if mother and daughter could never in this life meet face to face. I stated my errand gradually to Mam- my Nelly when I went to see her the next day. I reminded her of our con- versation about her daughter. \u2018\u2018f think I have found out something about her.\u201d \u2018\u2018Are she a-libin\u2019 ?\u201d asked the old wo- man, eagerly. \u2018\u201cT think not, unless I am all wrong,\u201d I answered, gently. \u201cT eud hardly hab expected it,\u201d she said, shaking her head, sadly. \u2018\u2018Forty years sence she war sol\u2019 away. Heaps ob changes comes in forty years. But you go on, boney. Tell me wat you hab heerd.\u201d \u201cT have seen the daughter of a wo- man whose name was Matilda Smith, and who was sold out of the Smith fam- ily in Virginia into the Levere family in Louisiana.\u201d \u201cDat mus\u2019 be my \u2018Tilda. Good This Matilda Lor\u2019!\u201d \u201cSo it seems to me. Smith was set free by her master, and afterward married a man who was also free, with whom she went to live in Texas, pear San Antonio.\u201d \u201cTt war near San Antonio dat J libed four year, off an\u2019 on.\u201d \u2018How strange that is! Yon were so near that you might aimost have touched each other, and never knew it.\u201d I could have wept to think of it\u2014the joy of meeting so close to them, and yet they had not met! Where had their guardian angels been all those months? \u201cAfterward Matilda Smith died,\u201d I went on. \u2018\u2018She left one daughter, who is living with her husband and child in Port Royal now. She is Mrs. Fitzwal- ter; her husband is a preacher. She has her mother\u2019s picture, which looks extremely like you, Mammy Nelly. Would you like to see it ?\u201d \u2018*Indeed I wud, chile,\u201d the old wo- man answered, with trembliug eager- ness. I brought about an interview. The relationship between Mrs, Fitzwalter and Mammy Nelly was established be- yond any reasonable doubt, and the most cordial family relations were established. Mammy\u2019s whole heart went out to her little great-grandson. \u201cMy \u2019Tilda war on\u2019y a trifle older when she went away.\u201d I had occasion to interview Mr, Fitz- walter on parochial matters about this time. He alluded to the discovery of pis wife\u2019s kindred. \u201cTt is a series of circumstances, so to speak,\u201d he remarked. \u2018I could have wished my good mother. in-law had lived to see this day. Instead of which, she has departed to the blush unseen.\u201d Shades of the poet Gray!--Harper's Weeekly.", "31": "Charles Stewart Parnell was arrested at Morrison\u2019s Hotel, in Dublin, early Thursday morning on two warrants signed by Mr. Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland. One warrant charges him with inciting the intimidation of tenants from paying rent justly due, and the other with intimidating tenants from taking the benefit of the Land act, by applying to the Land Commission to fix a fair rent. Mr. Parnell was taken to Kilmainham jail. His arrest has created great excitement. His arrest was determined on ata pro- longed session of the Cabinet Council, at which all the members of the Council except Lord Selborne were present. Since Mr. Gladstone\u2019s speeches at Leeds some of the Ministerial journals in Lon- don have been saying vaguely that im- inediate executive interference was nec- essary to make the Land act anythino but a dead letter, The arrest or Par- nell, however, was entirely unexpected. Immediately after the close of the Cabi- net Council Secretary Forster left Lon- don for Dublin, and upon his arrival there by the morning mail at 8 o\u2019clock Thursday, issued forthwith his warrants to the Dublin Detective Office. Mr, Par- nell was stopping at Morrison\u2019s, aud was to take a morning train from the Kingsbridge station to attend the con- vention of the Kildare Land and Labor League. One squad of detectives, fol- lowed by a considerabie military force, went into the railway station, where, a crowd had gathered to see Mr. Parnell off. It was thought likely that he had already boarded his train. The detec- tives went over the train without at- tracting attention, and the crowd sup- posed that the soldiers had been called out merely to preserve order. Meanwhile, under command of Detec- tive Superintendent Mallins, six detec- tives went to Morrison\u2019s hotel, which had been carefully watched from the time Mr. Parnell entered it last evening. All were in citizen\u2019s clothes. Superin- tendent Mallins found that Parnell was stillin bed, and sent up word that he would Jike to see him. Mr. Parnell re- turned a message that he would see the Superintendent as soon as he was dressed, and presently word came down that he was ready. Mallins took Deteec- tive Sheridan up stairs with him. Mr, Parnell received them pleasantly, and asked if he was to be arrested. Mallins handed him one of the warrants. The ink of Chief Secretary Forster's signa- ture was not yet dry. Mallins suggested that Mr. Parnell go with him quietly and immediately, so that there should be no chance of a disturbance. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Parnell, and put on his hat. The two policemen escorted him to the door, where a cab was wait- ing for bim. It was then half past nine. The cad was driven directly to Kilmain- ham prison, the other detectives follow- ing in another carriage. Mr. Parnell was warmly welcomed by the suspects in the prison. Nobody at the hotel and none of the bystanders on the street knew that Mr. Parnell was under arrest, and there was no demonstration of any kind. There was a good deal of excite- ment, however, over the news when it became known, and the newspaper offices were besieged. On the chance of a disturbance, the entire garrison of the city is in barracks, held ready to march atany moment. It was reported that the arrest of Parnell was only a prelimi- nary to still more vigorous action against the Land League. The Secre- tary of the League was interviewed shortly after the arrest. He expressed much astonishment at it, and exclaimed, \u201cTet them come on; we are ready for them!\u201d Father Sheehy, Patrick Egan and V. B. Dillon went to Paris to-day. It is believed that Parrell\u2019s speech at Wexford Sunday furnished the Govern- ment\u2019s technical justification for his ar- rest, which the Moderate Liberals and the Conservatives approve. The Land League Executive held a long session Thursday at Morrison\u2019s, Messrs. John Dillon, Arthur O\u2019Connor and A. M. Sullivan, members of Parlia- ment, were present. Mr, Dillon made a fiery speech, and 1t was proposed that the Leagne should issue an address. It is said that Mr. Dillon, who is M. P. for Tipperary, will assume the Presidency of the League. Mr. Dillon said at the meeting that it was the most trying and critical moment in Ireland\u2019s history for a century. The statement that Mr. Parnell had intimi- dated the people was false. He detied anybody to point toasingle speech of Mr. Parnell in favor of intimidation, His arrest was due to private malice. It was the duty of the nation to deal with the maiter coolly and with judgment, and to maintain the struggle within the law. An additional guard and two nine- pounders have been stationed in the upper Castle yard. The guard at Kil- mainham jail has been doubled. At a meeting of the North Dablin Board of Guardians, Mr. Kenny, the medical officer and medical attendant upon the suspects in Kilmainham jail, stated that he feared Mr. Kettle, the suspect, was threatened with spinal disease, and that there could not be the slightest doubt that Mr. Kettle\u2019s syraptoms were due to his confinemevt. Mr. Kenny added that he had reported to the Government on the subject.
