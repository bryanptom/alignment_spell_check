 <br/>Ethel Bruce sat on a low rocker in the recess of the bay windows apparently in deep thought. A very pretty picture she made so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittle. Ivies were creeping above and around her head reaching after the sunlight while lilies geraniums and hyacinths were blooming at her feet. The gentlemen passed on as also did the hands of the clock but still Ethel sat in evident study. The room was furnished with cultured taste and skillful hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends. It was library and sitting room combined. Ethel parents had always striven to have their home attractive even if other expenses had to be curtailed very closely. The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of the mother were sadly missed by the daughter. tHe rest of the family said that Ethel took moth eros place to them all so well that for the time they were not great losers and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to be elsewhere rather then from actual pain said that she was having a rest in mind and body for eThel did not neglect anything and she kept the little mother fresh and dainty and the room so bright and cheery that all the family would gather around her in social glee. Ethel would first notice mothers tired look if they stayed too long and pleasantly chiding them would drive them off to the sitting room. Clay Whittle used often to come in with Hal to the mothers room and these little visits were seasons of de light to him His mother had passed the portals over into the other side. How he missed her room and her counsel and the time spent over at the Braces were choice minutes and great helps to him. His father was a leading politician bis sister a fashionable woman while he him self was a law student. The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together and on passing out from it she stopped a moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister. Clay she asked Why didn't you bring Eva Dayton this evening. I prefer the company TO have he answered. Company good enough I dare say but I like to see a girl with some style of dress. Everything she wears is a year old. Which of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world he answered joined Ethel and passed on. So on this the following morning Ethel was trying to study out some plans for new clothes. Of course she was indignant over the remark but it was true that all she had was a year old but she had felt that they were good enough until now. She knew too that all they had to live upon was her fathers salary which might have seemed large to many but their expenses were correspondingly large and with mothers sickness and Toms college bills or a part of them somebody had to economize and really deny them selves and she had felt willing and even anxious to do her share but after over hearing the remark of the night before denying herself had not been so sweet. She examined the closets to see if there was anything available to be made over but returned to her low rocker disheartened. Her father came in and seeing something amiss asked what are your thoughts like daughter and what are your wishes Speak and if half of the kingdom is desired it shall be yours I thought I was queen of the realm and mistress of all survey. I desire no more than the home kingdom with a robe of royal purple. Or some other fashionable shade he said. Frankly Ethel what were you thinking about I was wondering if there was any sur plus money in the family treasury that I could use for myself she said. I think about forty dollars. Would it help you Yes indeed. Just the sum I want. The father seemed to hesitate. Ethel spoke quickly I do not want it if it is needed elsewhere. I'll let you know at tea time he said. Will balance accounts for the month and rest assured you shall have it daughter if father can spare it and seated on one knee with her arm twined around his neck she stroked his manly beard caressing. We are not rich Ethel. he said but this home is ours and is a very pleasant and an attractive one and i have A family of whom I am both proud and thankful There is one thing upon which I con a late myself every week of my life and it is this that there are no be bills coming in for payment out period by family.

   <br/>Ethel Bruce sat on a low rocker in the recess of the bay windows, apparently in deep thought. A very pretty picture she made, so her Brother Hal thought as he passed along the street in company with Clay Whittle. Ivies were creeping above and around her head reaching after the sunlight, while lilies, geraniums, and hy- acinths were blooming at her feet. The gentlemen passed on, as also did the hands of the clock, but still Ethel sat in evident study. The room was furn- ished with cultured taste, and skillful hands kept it looking very inviting to the family and their friends. It was library and sitting room combined. Ethel's parents had always striven to have their home attractive, even if other expenses had to be curtailed very closely. The mother was an invalid and had been for several weeks, and the willing hands and thoughtful heart of the mother were sadly missed by the daughter. The rest of the family said "that Ethel took moth- er's place to them all so well, that for the time they were not great losers," and the mother confined to her room for lack of strength to be elsewhere, rather then from actual pain said "that she was having a rest in mind and body, for Ethel did not neglect anything" and she kept the little Mother fresh and dainty, and the room so bright and cheery, that all the family would gather around her in social glee. Ethel would first notice mother's tired look if they stayed too long, and pleasantly chiding them would drive them off to the sitting room. Clay Whittle used often to come in with Hal to the mother's room, and these little visits were seasons of de- light to him. His mother had passed the portals over into the other side. How he missed her room and her counsel, and the time spent over at the Bruces, were choice minutes and great helps to him. His father was a leading politician, his sister a fashionable woman, while he him- self was a law student. The evening before Clay and Ethel had attended an entertainment together and on passing out from it, she stopped a moment to speak to a friend and Clay was joined by his sister. Clay she asked "Why didn't you bring Eva Dryton this evening." "I prefer the company I have." he answered. "Company good enough I dare say, but I like to see a girl with some style of dress. Everything she wears is a year old." "Which of itself is a crime of the first degree in the fashionable world" he answered : joined Ethel and passed on. So on this the following morning, Ethel was trying to study out some plans for new clothes. Of course she was indig- nant over the remark, but it was true that all she had, was a year old, but she had felt that they were good enough, until now. She knew too, that all they had to live upon was her father's salary, which might have seemed large to many, but their expenses were correspondingly large, and with mother's sickness and Tom's college bills, or a part of them, somebody had to economize and really deny them- selves, and she had felt willing, and even anxious to do her share; but after over- hearing the remark of the night before, denying herself had not been so sweet. She examined the closets to see if there was anything available to be made over, but returned to her low rocker disheart- ened. Her father came in, and seeing something amiss, asked, "What are your thoughts like, daughter, and what are your wishes? Speak, and if half of the kingdom is desired, it shall be yours!" "I thought I was queen of the realm, and mistress of all I survey. I desire no more than the home kingdom, with a robe of royal purple." "Or some other fashionable shade," he said. "Frankly, Ethel, what were you thinking about?" "I was wondering if there was any sur- plus money in the family treasury, that I could use for myself," she said. "I think about forty dollars. Would it help you?" "Yes, indeed. Just the sum I want." The father seemed to hesitate. Ethel spoke quickly, "I do not want it if it is needed elsewhere." "I'll let you know at tea-time," he said. "Will balance accounts for the month, and rest assured, you shall have it, daughter, if father can spare it," and seated on one knew with her arm twined around his neck, she stroked his manly beard, ca- ressingly. "We are not rich, Ethel." he said, "but this home is ours, and is a very pleasant, and an attractive one, and I have a family of whom I am both proud and thankful. There is one thing upon which I congrat- ulate myself every week of my life, and it is this--that there are no unexpected bills coming in for payment contracted by my family.
