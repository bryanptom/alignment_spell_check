Her father came in and seeing something amiss asked What are your thoughts like daughter and what are your wishes Speak and if half of the kingdom is desired it shall be yours!\u201d I thought I was queen of the reilm, and mistress of all lsurvey.  I desire no more than the home kingdom with a robe of royal purple. \u201d\u2019 fOr some other fashionable shade,\u2019 he said \u2018*frankly, Ethel what were you thinking about?\u201d a I was wondering if there was any sure plus money in the family treasury that I could use for myself,\u201d she said I think about forty dollars Would it help you?\u2019 \u201cyes, indeed Just the sum I want. \u201d\u2019 The father seemed to hesitate Ethel spoke quickly I do not want it if it is needed eleswhere. \u201d I'II let you know at tea-time,\u201d\u2019 he said Will balance accounts for the month and rest assured you shall have it daughter if father can spare it,\u2019 and seated on one knee with her arm twined around his neck she stroked his manly beard can ressingly.
